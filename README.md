# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge Assignment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All code was written and tested by myself, Ryan MacFarlane. No tutor was used, but I did receive help and guidance from the Xpert Learning AI Assistant on the BCS website.

All code was written and tested using Visual Studio Code.

PLEASE NOTE - I reviewed the grading rubric for this assignment and in the two composite plots toward the end of the assignment, the instructions state that the plus (+) operator needs to be used to combine the plots.  However, when I used the plus operator, it gave me two plots side-by-side, which I did not like - at least for the elbow graph.  I used the star (*) operator for the elbow graph, which gave both elbow lines overlain - which shows their contrast better I believe.  I think that is more in-line with what the exercise was looking for, at least for the elbow graph.  For the Scatter plot, I used + as requested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git commands used in command prompt (as requested) : 

git add .

git commit -m "Script complete, ready to turn in"

git push origin main
